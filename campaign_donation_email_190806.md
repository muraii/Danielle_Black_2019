Dear friends and family,

I'm running for Norwood city council this fall and am seeking your donations to support my campaign.

Norwood has potential to thrive but our roads, sidewalks, and buildings are in various stages of disrepair and make living here less desirable for current and future residents. This state of our city also affects our capacity to attract businesses and consumers. This is especially problematic because Norwood has been in financial crisis for years and without improving our ability to generate revenue the city will continue to struggle. We can start addressing these issues by making the city's administration more accessible and their work more transparent, but only by changing the guard.

These issues don't get fixed by wishful thinking. We need people who will stand up for Norwood's citizens and make tough, fair decisions. I'm ready to start doing just that, today. I hope you can support my campaign. Even a small donation helps.

 Here are the ways you can make a donation:
